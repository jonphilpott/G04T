<p>G0-4T is the game that pits two people crazy enough to play a
competitive assembly language game against each other in a battle of
bit twiddling skill.</p>

<p>The object is much like Core-War where you must destroy your opponent
by forcing them to execute a bad instruction. Each player is given up
to four threads, once all 4 of your threads are dead, so are you. Also,
watch out for bonuses, powerups and traps.</p>

<p>Your interface into the game is via gamepads, which, I believe, makes
this the first gamepad driven assembler ever, impressed? You can move
throughout the memory space and alter its contents to build your
program - what's stopping you from just scrolling to your opponents
space and messing them up? well, nothing - except each player has a 64
byte "protected zone" that only that player can alter with their
gamepad - if your code is outside of that area, it's in danger. There
is, however, nothing stopping your opponents CODE from altering the
memory inside your protected area.</p>

<p>This game was developed on the Raspberry-Pi using SDL and Emacs. Enjoy.</p>
